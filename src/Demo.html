    </h1>
    <p>
      This is the SysExEdit Demo. To run it, you need a browser that
      fully supports Java 1.1 applets.  For instance, Netscape 4.07
      should work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press the button below (which will appear when the binary
      code of the application has completely been loaded), this will
      bring up a window with the SysExEdit utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Please note, that the binary code of the application
        (including the java swing classes) covers about 2.5MBytes of
        binary data.  Depending on the connectivity and your
        computer's speed, it may take some minutes before the button
        below appears.  Moreover, the initialization of the swing
        classes also takes a while (on my P133, it takes about 1
        minute).  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you still want to see the application, just wait until the
      button appears, and then press it to start!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also note, that most browsers do not allow read/write
      access to your local file system. Consequently, you can not load
      or save any data, unless you tell your browser to turn off its
      security manager (which is, for example, possible with the
      HotJava(tm) browser).

      You should see here a java applet that demonstrates the
      SysExEdit utility. Well, if your browser only shows this text,
      then your browser probably does not support java 1.1 applets
      :-(. You probably should get more recent browser software.
