<BODY BGCOLOR = "#ffffff">
<H1><CENTER>SysExEdit Demo</CENTER></H1> This is the SysExEdit
Demo. To run it, you need a browser that fully supports Java 1.1 applets.
For instance, Netscape 4.07 should work.
<P>
If you press the button below (which will appear when the binary code
of the application has completely been loaded), this will bring up a
window with the SysExEdit utility.
<P>
<B>Please note, that the binary code of the application (including the
java swing classes) covers about 2.5MBytes of binary data. Depending
on the connectivity and your computer's speed, it may take some
minutes before the button below appears. Moreover, the initialization
of the swing classes also takes a while (on my P133, it takes about
1 minute). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</B>
<P>
If you still want to see the application, just wait until the button
appears, and then press it to start!

<P>
Please also note, that most browsers do not allow read/write access to
your local file system. Consequently, you can not load or save any
data, unless you tell your browser to turn off its security manager
(which is, for example, possible with the HotJava(tm) browser).<BR>

<HR>
You should see here a java applet that demonstrates the SysExEdit
utility. Well, if your browser only shows this text, then your browser
probably does not support java 1.1 applets :-(. You probably should get
more recent browser software.
