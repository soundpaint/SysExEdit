	SysExEdit release 1.0-alpha1

These are the release notes for the SysExEdit system, release
1.0-alpha1. Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all
about, explain how to install the system, and what to do if something
goes wrong. 

WHAT IS SYSEXEDIT?

  SysExEdit is a Java(tm)-based utility for creating MIDI messages
  or MIDI files that contain SysEx messages for synthesizers and other
  MIDI hardware. This utility assumes that the configuration of MIDI
  hardware can be applied by direct memory access via system exclusive
  messages. In fact, this is possible with most modern synthesizers.
  SysExEdit is very flexible and customizable to a variety of specific
  MIDI hardware; there is sample code included for a Yamaha(tm)
  DB50XG/MU50 board, which is an XG(tm) compatible device.

  SysExEdit is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

  SysExEdit is fully written in Java; so, virtually, it runs on any
  platform that a java runtime environment (JRE) is available for.
  SysExEdit requires JRE/JDK1.1.x or higher.

DOCUMENTATION:

  The directory doc contains a collection of various documentation in
  specific subdirectories.

  - The directory doc/api contains the API documentation in html
    format as generated from the javadoc utility.

INSTALLING:

  Create a directory that will harbour the SysExEdit system, e.g.:

	mkdir C:\SysExEdit			% Windows95/NT(tm)

	mkdir $HOME/SysExEdit			% Unix(tm)

  Copy the compressed file SysExEdit.tgz or SysExEdit.zip into this
  directory. Go into the directory with the command `cd'. Uncompress
  the file with

	unzip SysExEdit.zip

  or

	gunzip -c SysExEdit.tgz | tar -xf -

COMPILING:

  With the shell command `cd', go into the directory that contains
  this README file.

  On Unix systems, type `make all'.

  On Windows95/NT systems, type `make.bat'.
