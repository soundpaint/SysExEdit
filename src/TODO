* find a better name, e.g. SynthEdit or MIDI Factory or MIDI Fab or
	MIDIATOR or SysExitor or MIDI Manager or Synth Manager or ...

* event list editor:
	* enable/disable reception of NRPN messages

* documentation: general concepts:
	* editors on arbitrary data: insert, change, delete
		(cut & paste = special form of delete & insert)
	* editors on structured data:
		* constant structure: change only (e.g. options
			dialog)
		* SysExEdit: constant structure
	* explain concept of source/target window
		* motivation: special functions such as merge or
			copy block of data

* MIDI bulk dump:
	must be able to insert forced delays for slow synthesizers;
	encode delay time into the nodes of the tree
	structure (e.g. along with variable offset in class MapNode)

* Load from file / bulk request:
	* Allow the user to specify locators (start/end) to extract
		the state at a specific time in a long MIDI file
	* When SysEx data is redefined within a single MIDI file, allow
		certain solution strategies for such collisions:
			* just overwrite old SysEx data
			* if first overwrite is detected, stop immediately
			* divide the file into pieces with contigous blocks
				of SysEx data
			* allow overwrite only of certain data (e.g.
				a certain controller)
