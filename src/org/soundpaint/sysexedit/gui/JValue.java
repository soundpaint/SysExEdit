/**
 * A JValue is a value for use in the Java GUI, e.g. in a JComboBox.
 * It contains an integer value as system value for internal use and a
 * value type with type information, including a renderer for
 * displaying the value to the user.  The display value is not
 * considered to be constant, e.g. when switching between languages;
 * it is just for display to the user.  The system value, however, is
 * assumed to have constant semantics.  For example, when representing
 * a day of week, the integer system value "0" may constantly
 * represent a Sunday, "1" = Monday, "2" = Tuesday, etc.  The display
 * value for Sunday may be "Sunday" in English language, or "Sonntag"
 * in German language.  When changing the language, the system value
 * "0" keeps unmodified, but the display value may change e.g. from
 * "Sunday" to "Sonntag".
