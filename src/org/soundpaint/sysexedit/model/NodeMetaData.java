  /**
   * Creates a folder node's metadata, consisting of a description,
   * label and desired address.
   * @param description An optional informal description of this
   * FolderNode.  Useful e.g. as tooltip in the GUI.
   * @param label The label of this node.
   * @param desiredAddress If negative, automatically determine an
   *    absolute address for this node.  If non-negative, request that
   *    this node will appear at the specified absolute address in the
   *    address space.  Effectively, by setting an absolute address,
   *    an area of inaccessible memory bits will precede this node's
   *    data in order to make this node appear at the desired address.
   *    If specifying an absolute address, it must be chosen such that
   *    all previous nodes' memory mapped values (with respect to
   *    depth first search order) fit into the address space range
   *    preceding the desired address.  Note that validity check for
   *    this restriction will be made only upon completion of the tree
   *    and thus may result in throwing an exception some time later.
