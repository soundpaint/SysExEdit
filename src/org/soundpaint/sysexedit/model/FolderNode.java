/**
 * This class is used to represent a node in the hierarchical
 * structure of the whole memory of a device.  A node may or may not
 * carry a data value.  Address mapping is done in two steps: First of
 * all, the map is assumed to represent a linear addressed array of
 * bits of memory, starting with address 0x0.  By default, addresses
 * will be implicitly assigned to all nodes, such that the resulting
 * map has no address gap.  However, for devices that use a sparse
 * address layout, for every node, optionally, its desired address may
 * be explicitly specified when creating the node.  Note that it is
 * the responsibility of the device model to choose desired addresses
 * in such a way, that the nodes inbetween fit into the address range
 * resulting from the desired addresses.  After the memory map has
 * been created, actually addresses are resolved, considering any
 * desired address specified by the device model.  If it turns out
 * that the desired addresses do not fit, an exception will be thrown.
